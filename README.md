# Getting Started with Network Analysis in Python


## Agenda

This webinar covers a lot in a short period of time!

* Components of a network: Nodes & Edges
* Three ways to create a graph in NetworkX:
    * pandas edgelist
    * adjacency matrix
    * JSON file
* Capturing motion with directed and weighted graphs
* Measuring importance with three types of centrality:
    * Degree centrality
    * Betweenness centrality
    * Closeness centrality

**Note**: Whether you're watching live or recorded, you can use the main Jupyter Notebook to follow along. Also, feel free to use the code snippets for your own network analysis projects - I'd love to see anything you do with it! üëç
